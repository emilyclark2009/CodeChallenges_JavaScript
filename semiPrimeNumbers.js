SEMI-PRIME NUMBERS
Semi-Prime Numbers
Create a semiPrimeCount() function that takes in an integer, n, and returns the count of semi-prime numbers from 1 to n, non-inclusive. A semi-prime number is a number that is the product of two prime numbers. Note that the numbers don’t have to be distinct, meaning that 4 is a semi-prime number since it is 2 * 2.

For example, semiPrimeCount() called on 10 should return 3 since there are 3 semi-prime numbers from 1-10 (4, 6, 9). Remember, it’s non-inclusive!

Variations of this challenge were reported to have been asked at interviews with Google. If you’ve covered the material in Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge with there first.
